<h2>Diagnosis Of (vertigo) Paroymsal  Positional Vertigo:</h2>

Your doctor may do a series of tests to determine the cause of your dizziness. During a physical exam, your doctor will likely look for:<br>
<ul>
	<li>Signs and symptoms of dizziness that are prompted by eye or head movements and then decrease in less than one minute</li><br>
	<li>Dizziness with specific eye movements that occur when you lie on your back with your head turned to one side and tipped slightly over the edge of the examination bed</li><br>
	<li>Involuntary movements of your eyes from side to side</li><br>
	<li>Inability to control your eye movements</li><br>
</ul>


<h2>Treatment Of (vertigo) Paroymsal  Positional Vertigo:</h2>

Benign paroxysmal positional vertigo may go away on its own within a few weeks or months. But, to help relieve BPPV sooner, your doctor, audiologist or physical therapist may treat you with a series of movements known as the canalith repositioning procedure.<br>

<h4>Canalith repositioning</h4>
Performed in your doctor's office, the canalith repositioning procedure consists of several simple and slow maneuvers for positioning your head. The goal is to move particles from the fluid-filled semicircular canals of your inner ear into a tiny baglike open area (vestibule) that houses one of the otolith organs in your ear, where these particles don't cause trouble and are more easily resorbed.

Each position is held for about 30 seconds after any symptoms or abnormal eye movements stop. This procedure usually works after one or two treatments.<br>

<h4>Surgical alternative</h4>
In rare situations when the canalith repositioning procedure doesn't work, your doctor may recommend a surgical procedure. In this procedure, a bone plug is used to block the portion of your inner ear that's causing dizziness. The plug prevents the semicircular canal in your ear from being able to respond to particle movements or head movements in general. The success rate for canal plugging surgery is about 90%.<br>

<h4>Lifestyle and home remedies</h4>
If you experience dizziness associated with BPPV, consider these tips:<br>
<ul>
	<li>Be aware of the possibility of losing your balance, which can lead to falling and serious injury.</li>
	<li>Avoid movements, such as looking up, that bring on the symptoms.</li>
	<li>Sit down immediately when you feel dizzy.</li>
	<li>Use good lighting if you get up at night.</li>
	<li>Walk with a cane for stability if you're at risk of falling.</li>
	<li>Work closely with your doctor to manage your symptoms effectively.</li>
</ul>
