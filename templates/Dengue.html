<h2>Diagnosis Of Dengue:</h2>

Diagnosing dengue fever can be difficult, because its signs and symptoms can be easily confused with those of other diseases — such as malaria, leptospirosis and typhoid fever.<br>

Your doctor will likely ask about your medical and travel history. Be sure to describe international trips in detail, including the countries you visited and the dates, as well as any contact you may have had with mosquitoes.<br>

Certain laboratory tests can detect evidence of the dengue viruses, but test results usually come back too late to help direct treatment decisions.<br>

<h2>Treatment Of Dengue:</h2>

No specific treatment for dengue fever exists. Your doctor may recommend that you drink plenty of fluids to avoid dehydration from vomiting and a high fever.<br>

Acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) can alleviate pain and reduce fever. Avoid pain relievers that can increase bleeding complications — such as aspirin, ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin IB, others) and naproxen sodium (Aleve, others).<br>
<br>

If you have severe dengue fever, you may need:<br>

<ul>
	<li>Supportive care in a hospital</li><br>
	<li>Intravenous (IV) fluid and electrolyte replacement</li><br>
	<li>Blood pressure monitoring</li><br>
	<li>Transfusion to replace blood loss</li><br>
</ul>
