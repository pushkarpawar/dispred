<h2>PREVENTION OF DRUG REACTION:</h2>

<p>There is generally no way to prevent a drug allergy.If you have a known drug allergy, avoiding the drug is the best way to prevent an allergic reaction. You may also be told to avoid similar medicines.<br>
	In some cases, a provider may approve the use of a drug that causes an allergy if you are first treated with medicines that slow or block the immune response. These include corticosteroids (such as prednisone) and antihistamines. Do not try this without a provider's supervision. Pretreatment with corticosteroids and antihistamines has been shown to prevent allergic reactions in people who need to get x-ray contrast dye.<br>
    Your provider may also recommend desensitization.
</p>

<h2>TREATMENT OF DRUG REACTION:</h2>

<p>The goal of treatment is to relieve symptoms and prevent a severe reaction. Treatment may include: <br>
	<ul>
		<li>Antihistamines to relieve mild symptoms such as rash, hives, and itching
Bronchodilators such as albuterol to reduce asthma-like symptoms (moderate wheezing or cough)
Corticosteroids applied to the skin, given by mouth, or given through a vein (intravenously)
Epinephrine by injection to treat anaphylaxis
The offending medicine and similar drugs should be avoided. Make sure all your providers -- including dentists and hospital staff -- know about any drug allergies that you or your children have.</li><br>

<li>In some cases, a penicillin (or other drug) allergy responds to desensitization. This treatment involves being given very small doses at first, followed by larger and larger doses of a medicine to improve your tolerance of the drug. This process should be done only by an allergist, when there is no alternative drug for you to take.</li><br>

</ul>

<h2>When to Contact a Medical Professional:</h2>

<p>Call your provider if you are taking a medicine and seem to be having a reaction to it.<br>

Go to the emergency room or call the local emergency number (such as 911) if you have difficulty breathing or develop other symptoms of severe asthma or anaphylaxis. These are emergency conditions.</p>
