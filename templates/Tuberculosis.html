<h2>Diagnosis Of Tuberculosis:</h2>

During the physical exam, your doctor will check your lymph nodes for swelling and use a stethoscope to listen carefully to the sounds your lungs make while you breathe.<br>

The most commonly used diagnostic tool for tuberculosis is a simple skin test, though blood tests are becoming more commonplace. A small amount of a substance called PPD tuberculin is injected just below the skin of your inside forearm. You should feel only a slight needle prick.<br>

Within 48 to 72 hours, a health care professional will check your arm for swelling at the injection site. A hard, raised red bump means you're likely to have TB infection. The size of the bump determines whether the test results are significant.<br>
<br>

<h2>Treatment Of Tuberculosis:</h2>

Medications are the cornerstone of tuberculosis treatment. But treating TB takes much longer than treating other types of bacterial infections.

For active tuberculosis, you must take antibiotics for at least six to nine months. The exact drugs and length of treatment depend on your age, overall health, possible drug resistance and the infection's location in the body.<br>

If you have latent tuberculosis, you may need to take only one or two types of TB drug. Active tuberculosis, particularly if it's a drug-resistant strain, will require several drugs at once. The most common medications used to treat tuberculosis include:<br>
<ul>
	<li>Isoniazid</li><br>
	<li>Rifampin (Rifadin, Rimactane)</li><br>
	<li>Ethambutol (Myambutol)</li><br>
	<li>Pyrazinamide</li><br>
</ul>
<br>

If you have drug-resistant TB, a combination of antibiotics called fluoroquinolones and injectable medications, such as amikacin or capreomycin (Capastat), are generally used for 20 to 30 months. Some types of TB are developing resistance to these medications as well.<br>

Some drugs may be used as add-on therapy to the current drug-resistant combination treatment, including:<br>
<ul>
	<li>Bedaquiline (Sirturo)</li><br>
	<li>Linezolid (Zyvox)</li><br>
</ul>
<br>

<b>Completing treatment is essential</b><br>
<br>
After a few weeks, you won't be contagious and you may start to feel better. It might be tempting to stop taking your TB drugs. But it is crucial that you finish the full course of therapy and take the medications exactly as prescribed by your doctor. Stopping treatment too soon or skipping doses can allow the bacteria that are still alive to become resistant to those drugs, leading to TB that is much more dangerous and difficult to treat.<br>

To help people stick with their treatment, a program called directly observed therapy (DOT) is recommended. In this approach, a health care worker administers your medication so that you don't have to remember to take it on your own.<br>
