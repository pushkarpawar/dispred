<h2>Diagnosis Of Hepatitis C:</h2>

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that all adults ages 18 to 79 years be screened for hepatitis C, even those without symptoms or known liver disease. Screening for HCV is especially important if you're at high risk of exposure, including:<br>

<ul>
	<li>Anyone who has ever injected or inhaled illicit drugs</li><br>
	<li>Anyone who has abnormal liver function test results with no identified cause</li><br>
	<li>Babies born to mothers with hepatitis C</li><br>
	<li>Health care and emergency workers who have been exposed to blood or accidental needle sticks</li><br>
	<li>People who have undergone long-term hemodialysis treatments</li><br>
</ul>

If an initial blood test shows that you have hepatitis C, additional blood tests will:<br>
<ul>
	<li>Measure the quantity of the hepatitis C virus in your blood (viral load)</li><br>
	<li>Identify the genotype of the virus</li><br>
</ul>

<h2>Treatment Of Hepatitis C:</h2>

<b>Antiviral medications</b><br>
<br>

Hepatitis C infection is treated with antiviral medications intended to clear the virus from your body. The goal of treatment is to have no hepatitis C virus detected in your body at least 12 weeks after you complete treatment.<br>

Researchers have recently made significant advances in treatment for hepatitis C using new, "direct-acting" antiviral medications, sometimes in combination with existing ones. As a result, people experience better outcomes, fewer side effects and shorter treatment times â€” some as short as eight weeks. The choice of medications and length of treatment depend on the hepatitis C genotype, presence of existing liver damage, other medical conditions and prior treatments.<br>
<br>

<b>Liver transplantation</b><br>
<br>
If you have developed serious complications from chronic hepatitis C infection, liver transplantation may be an option. During liver transplantation, the surgeon removes your damaged liver and replaces it with a healthy liver. Most transplanted livers come from deceased donors, though a small number come from living donors who donate a portion of their livers.<br>

In most cases, a liver transplant alone doesn't cure hepatitis C. The infection is likely to return, requiring treatment with antiviral medication to prevent damage to the transplanted liver. Several studies have demonstrated that new, direct-acting antiviral medication regimens are effective at curing post-transplant hepatitis C. At the same time, treatment with direct-acting antivirals can be achieved in appropriately selected patients before liver transplantation.<br>
<br>

<b>Vaccinations</b><br>
<br>
Although there is no vaccine for hepatitis C, your doctor will likely recommend that you receive vaccines against the hepatitis A and B viruses. These are separate viruses that also can cause liver damage and complicate the course of chronic hepatitis C.<br>
